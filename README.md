Reflective Coating: Polymer-Based Cooling Solutions
CH507A: Dr. Manigandan | Jan-May 2025

Designed and fabricated polymer-based reflective coatings using TiO₂ nanoparticles embedded in PVP and PDADMAC matrices to enhance solar reflectance for passive cooling applications.

Employed the dip coating technique to achieve uniform thin films on glass substrates; optimized parameters such as TiO₂ concentration and withdrawal speed.

Characterized coatings through SEM cross-sectional imaging, UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometry, and electrical conductivity measurements, observing up to 35x improvement in conductivity with increased TiO₂ content.

Analyzed how polymer choice and nanoparticle loading affected film thickness, uniformity, aggregation behavior, and overall reflectance potential.

Identified 7.5% TiO₂ in PVP as an optimal composition offering a balance of thickness, uniformity, and conductivity for thermal management applications.

Proposed future work on mechanical stability, long-term environmental durability, and multifunctional coatings for scalable industrial applications.
